* Demonstrate that the simulators responses appear correct to A; that B is legitimate attacker in the IND-sWID-CPA model (which may be problematic if a hash collision occurs as a hash collision may allow the attacker to query the extract oracle on an identity which doesn't match the challenge pattern in the ROM-scheme but does match the challenge pattern when you hash it); and that the advantage of B in winning the game is polynomially related to the advantage of A in winning the game.
